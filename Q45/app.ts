//Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
//It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
//Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
//Print the Object that’s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

//Define a function to create a car object with optional options...
function create_car(manufacturer, model, ...options){
    //Initialize a car object with manufacturer and model
    let car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model,
    };

    //Add additional options to the car object
    options.forEach(option => {
        let[key, value] = option.split(":");
        car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
    });

    return car;
}

//Call the function to create a car object 
let my_car = create_car("Toyota","Corolla", "Color:Black", "Sunroof: True","Year: 2024");

//Print the variable to ensure all the information is stored correctly in the car object
console.log(my_car);
